1. What was the most challenging Git step? The hardest part for me was dealing with merge conflicts. It usually happened when I was working with teammates and we both edited the same file. Git would stop the merge and ask us to fix the conflict manually, which was confusing at first. I had to carefully check which changes to keep and which to remove. It felt stressful, but I got better at it after practicing and learning how Git works.

2. How did Vue components show reusability? Vue components were super helpful because I could use the same component in different parts of the app without rewriting anything. For example, I made a button component and used it on multiple pages just by changing the props. It made my code cleaner and easier to manage. Slots also helped me customize the content inside the component, which was really useful.

3. How would you extend this app? If I were to improve the app, I’d add features like user login and registration so people could save their data. I’d also connect it to an API to show real-time info depending on what the app does. Adding Vue Router would make it easier to move between pages. And maybe I’d turn it into a Progressive Web App so it works offline and can be installed on phones. That would make it more useful and fun to use.
