1.  What was the most challenging Git step?
The hardest part was making sure I used the right commands to push my changes and create the pull request. Sometimes I forgot to commit or pushed to the wrong branch.

2.  How did Vue components show reusability?
I used the same Vue component many times with different data. Instead of writing the same layout again, I just passed different props like name, language, and hobby


3. How would you extend this app?
I would add a form so users can add new classmates. Iâ€™d also make each card clickable to show more info, like their favorite project or a short bio.
