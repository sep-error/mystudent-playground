What was the most challenging Git step? The most challenging Git step was setting up the remote and pushing to the correct feature branch, especially when the automatic Pull Request prompt didnâ€™t appear and I had to manually compare branches.

How did Vue components show reusability? Vue components showed reusability through the StudentCard.vue, which accepted props and could be rendered multiple times with different data, making the UI modular and efficient.

How would you extend this app? To extend the app, I would add interactivity by allowing users to click on a student card to view more details, and integrate Vue Router for seamless navigation between components.
